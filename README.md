❤️ Heart Disease Analysis (UCI Dataset)

📊 Project Description
The Heart Disease Analysis project explores health indicators and their relationship to the presence of heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset. Through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis in Python and SQL, the project uncovers key patterns across age, gender, chest pain type, cholesterol, and other features, supporting early diagnosis, risk assessment, and personalized healthcare strategies.

🎯 Key Objectives

Analyze patient health indicators and their correlation with heart disease

Study demographic and clinical factors such as age, gender, cholesterol, and chest pain

Compare subgroup trends (e.g., age groups, male vs. female) using Python and SQL

Identify high-risk profiles to guide prevention and diagnosis

📂 Dataset

Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset

Features include:

Age, Gender, Chest Pain Type

Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar

Resting ECG Results, Maximum Heart Rate Achieved

Exercise-Induced Angina, ST Depression (oldpeak), Slope, Number of Major Vessels, Thalassemia

Target: Presence or absence of heart disease

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Programming Languages: Python, SQL

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Techniques: Data cleaning, categorical encoding, statistical analysis, SQL subgroup queries

Visualization: Histograms, KDE plots, box plots, count plots, comparative charts

📌 Key Insights

1️⃣ Age & Demographics

Middle-aged individuals (40–60 years) show higher vulnerability

Males appear more frequently and have a higher incidence of heart disease

2️⃣ Chest Pain Type

Asymptomatic chest pain strongly associated with heart disease

Typical and non-anginal types less frequently linked

3️⃣ Cholesterol & Blood Pressure

Cholesterol values mostly within normal ranges → limited predictive power

Resting blood pressure shows moderate variation but not a clear disease separator

4️⃣ Heart Rate & Cardiovascular Indicators

Patients with heart disease tend to have lower maximum heart rates

Exercise-induced angina, ST depression (oldpeak), and downsloping ST segment strongly correlate with disease

5️⃣ Fasting Blood Sugar

No significant difference between diseased and non-diseased groups → not a strong predictor in this dataset

📈 Project Outcomes

Identified key risk factors (age, gender, chest pain type, ECG, heart rate performance)

Highlighted non-predictive features (fasting blood sugar, cholesterol)

Demonstrated how SQL subgroup analysis enhances medical insights

Provides actionable recommendations for risk stratification and early detection
