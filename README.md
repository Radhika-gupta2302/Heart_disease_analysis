# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis (UCI Dataset)

---

## 📊 Project Description  
The **Heart Disease Analysis Project** explores health indicators and their relationship to the presence of heart disease using the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**.  
Through **data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis** in **Python and SQL**, this project uncovers key patterns across **age, gender, chest pain type, cholesterol, and other features**, supporting early diagnosis, risk assessment, and personalized healthcare strategies.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives  
- Analyze patient health indicators and their correlation with heart disease  
- Study demographic and clinical factors such as **age, gender, cholesterol, and chest pain**  
- Perform **subgroup analysis** (e.g., age groups, male vs. female) using Python and SQL  
- Identify **high-risk profiles** to guide prevention and diagnosis

## 📌 Key Insights  

### 1️⃣ Age & Demographics  
- Middle-aged individuals (**40–60 years**) show **higher vulnerability**  
- **Males** appear more frequently and show a **higher incidence of heart disease**  

### 2️⃣ Chest Pain Type  
- **Asymptomatic chest pain** → strongly associated with heart disease  
- Typical and non-anginal pain → less predictive  

### 3️⃣ Cholesterol & Blood Pressure  
- Cholesterol values mostly within **normal ranges** → limited predictive power  
- Resting blood pressure shows variation but not a clear disease separator  

### 4️⃣ Heart Rate & Cardiovascular Indicators  
- Patients with heart disease tend to have **lower maximum heart rates**  
- **Exercise-induced angina, ST depression (oldpeak), and downsloping ST segment** show strong correlation with disease  

### 5️⃣ Fasting Blood Sugar  
- No significant difference between diseased and non-diseased groups  
- → **Not a strong predictor** in this dataset

## 📈 Project Outcomes  
- Identified **key risk factors** → age, gender, chest pain type, ECG, heart rate performance  
- Highlighted **non-predictive features** → fasting blood sugar, cholesterol  
- Showcased **SQL subgroup analysis** for deeper medical insights  
- Provided **actionable recommendations** for risk stratification and early detection
