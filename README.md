Heart Disease Risk Analysis
Introduction
Heart disease is a leading global health concern, making early
detection and risk factor analysis essential. This project analyzes
patient health records to identify patterns and associations related
to heart disease presence.
Using subgroup analysis and visual exploration, we examine how
factors like age, gender, chest pain type, cholesterol, and exercise
response impact disease risk. The study employs SQL and Python
tools to uncover meaningful insights that support improved
screening and prevention strategies.
Conclusion
This analysis highlights key factors associated with heart
disease, including age, gender, chest pain type, exercise-
induced angina, and ECG findings. Middle-aged males,
especially those with asymptomatic chest pain or exercise-
triggered angina, show a higher risk. While traditional
markers like cholesterol and fasting blood sugar appear
less predictive on their own, combining multiple indicators
provides more accurate insights.
By leveraging data analysis techniques, we gain a deeper
understanding of heart disease patternsâ€”supporting early
detection, targeted screening, and better preventive
strategies.
